## Why should I change my representative?

In Nano, representatives act as accounts that cast votes when global network consensus is required. ([Source](https://nanowallet.io/))

By changing your representative you give your voting power to a node that votes on your behalf.

## How do I change my Nano representative?

Please choose your wallet below:

- [nanowallet.io](wallets/nanowalletio.md)
- [nanovault.io](wallets/nanovaultio.md)
- [Canoe](wallets/canoe.md)

_Your wallet is missing? [Add it on GitHub](https://github.com/nanotools/Change-Nano-Representative)!_

## Where can I find a good representative?

You should know the maintainer and why he runs his representative.

Additionally the representative should have:
- A high uptime
- Below 1 % of total voting weight

If you don't know any node maintainer, here is a list with some good community representatives:

- [My Nano Ninja](https://mynano.ninja/)
- [NanoIsFast.com](https://nanoisfast.com/decentralized-nano-representatives/)
- [Nanode21.cloud](https://nanode21.cloud/representatives.php)
- [Nanode.co](https://www.nanode.co/representatives)


## Can I be my own representative?

Sure! We suggest the [Easy Nano Node](https://nanotools.github.io/easy-nano-node/) setup, this takes only 5 minutes!
