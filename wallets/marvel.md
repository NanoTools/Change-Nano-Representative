Hi everyone, my name is Christophe (Marvel my nickname, not the company!), I live in France.
I've been running a rep node on Azure since Feb 23rd, I've created a reddit post here, with some data about my node: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/7xy6jz/i_would_be_happy_to_become_your_representative/

My node adress is xrb_3caprkc56ebsaakn4j4n7g9p8h358mycfjcyzkrfw1nai6prbyk8ihc5yjjk

I fully support NANO, my goal is to help with decentralization. 
If you want to know if I'm someone you can trust, maybe my Ebay profile (marvel63) can help.
